# VIP Senders Configuration
#
# Define VIP senders with priority levels for accelerated handling.
# VIPs are color-coded in Apple Mail and can be forwarded to priority inbox.
#
# Priority Levels:
#   urgent  - Red color (1), highest priority, immediate attention
#   high    - Orange color (2), important, respond same day
#   medium  - Yellow color (3), notable, respond within 2 days
#
# Usage:
#   1. Add email addresses to appropriate priority levels
#   2. VIP rules are processed first (priority 1-3)
#   3. Emails are color-coded in Apple Mail for easy identification
#   4. Optional: Forward to separate priority inbox
