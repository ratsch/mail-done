# AI Category to Action Mapping
#
# PHILOSOPHY:
# - Organize into MD/ (MailDone) subfolder structure
# - Flag critical categories (work-urgent, invitation-speaking)
# - Auto-move bulk/noise to subfolders
# - Use database search/filters for finding specific types
# - Support multi-category classification (primary + optional secondary/tertiary)
#
# Multi-Category Configuration:
# - Primary category (always): Determines folder routing
# - Secondary category (~5%): Email needs action in second area
# - Tertiary category (<1%): Rarely, email needs action in third area
# - Multi-category emails stay in inbox by default for review
#
# Folder Structure:
#   MD/Applications/   - Application emails (PhD, Postdoc, etc.)
#   MD/Reviews/        - Review requests
#   MD/Personal/       - Personal correspondence
#   MD/Newsletters/    - Scientific journals, mailing lists
#   MD/Notifications/  - Automated systems (Sentry, calendar, social)
#   MD/Receipts/       - Purchases, travel bookings
#   MD/Marketing/      - Promotional emails
#   MD/Spam/           - Junk
#   MD/Publications/   - Publication lifecycle (submission, decisions, proofs)
#   MD/Grants/         - Grant lifecycle (submission, decisions, reporting)
#   MD/Travel/         - Travel bookings, itineraries, receipts
