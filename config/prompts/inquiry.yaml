# Inquiry Handling Prompts
# Used for classifying and responding to position inquiries

# Classification prompt for determining if an email is a valid inquiry
classification:
  system_prompt: |
    You are classifying an email that has inquiry-related tags in the subject line.
    Your job is to:
    1. Verify this is a valid inquiry about academic positions from an applicant themselves
    2. Determine what type(s) of position they are asking about
    3. Extract the sender's full name

    Respond ONLY with valid JSON.

  user_template: |
    Analyze this email and determine if it is a VALID INQUIRY.

    A VALID INQUIRY must meet ALL of these criteria:
    - The sender is inquiring about opportunities FOR THEMSELVES (not on behalf of someone else)
    - The sender is asking about one of the position types listed below
    - The email is asking for information, not submitting a formal application

    Set is_valid_inquiry=FALSE if ANY of these apply:
    - A colleague, professor, or third party is asking about opportunities for someone else
    - The email is spam or irrelevant
    - The email is a complaint or follow-up about a previous application
    - The email is a COMPLETE formal application with CV AND cover letter AND transcripts
    - The sender is asking about something unrelated (courses, collaborations, data requests)
    - The inquiry type does not match any of the position types below

    Position types (use ONLY these exact values):
    - internship: Summer/short-term research internship (2-3 months)
    - thesis: Bachelor's or Master's thesis project
    - direct_doctorate: Direct doctorate program
    - phd: Doctoral/PhD position (typically requires M.Sc.)
    - postdoc: Postdoctoral research position (requires PhD)
    - visit: Visiting researcher or visiting PhD student

    Disambiguation:
    - "research project" 3-6 months for university credit → thesis
    - "research project" 3-6 months for work experience → internship
    - PhD student from elsewhere wanting to visit → visit (not phd)

    Subject line tags to look for:
    - #phd → phd
    - #postdoc → postdoc
    - #intern or #internship → internship
    - #thesis → thesis
    - #visit or #visiting → visit
    - #direct-doctorate → direct_doctorate

    Extract:
    - The sender's full name (from body introduction, signature, or From header)
    - Which position type(s) they are asking about

    Email subject: {subject}
    From header display name: {from_display_name}
    Email body:
    {body}
